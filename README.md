# 🛡️ Layman-Friendly Vulnerability Scanner

This project presents a prototype vulnerability scanner designed specifically for **non-technical users**. It identifies third-party software installed on Windows systems, checks for known vulnerabilities via the **Vulners API**, and uses **ChatGPT** to explain each issue in **simple, non-technical language**. The final results are presented as a clean, user-friendly HTML report.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Scans installed third-party applications on Windows
- 🔍 Detects known vulnerabilities using Vulners API
- 💬 Generates plain-language explanations using ChatGPT
  - What the vulnerability is
  - Its potential impact
  - Recommended actions (e.g., update software)
- 🌐 Outputs results in a simple HTML report for easy review

## 📦 Installation

> **Note:** Python 3.8 or later is recommended.

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tashitams/my-vulscan.git
cd my-vulscan
```


### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


### 3. Add your API keys
Set the following API keys in the source code:
OPENAI_API_KEY (for ChatGPT)
VULNERS_API_KEY (for Vulners)


## 🧠 How It Works
- Uses Windows Registry to identify installed third-party software and versions.
- Normalizes software names to improve matching (removes x64/x86, version suffixes).
- Queries the Vulners API for known vulnerabilities.
- Selects the most severe vulnerability based on CVSS v3 score.
- Uses the OpenAI ChatGPT API to generate human-friendly explanations.
- Generates a clean HTML report summarizing the results.


## 📚 Academic Context
This project was developed as part of an academic research study on accessible cybersecurity tools. The goal was to explore whether simplifying vulnerability reports using large language models could improve awareness and security behavior among laypersons.


## 📌 Limitations
- Currently supports Windows only
- Does not perform automated remediation (e.g., installing updates)
- Requires an OpenAI API key for ChatGPT functionality
